# 📊 E-Commerce Sales Performance Dashboard (Power BI)

## 📝 Project Overview
This project analyzes sales and profitability trends from an e-commerce dataset (Sample Superstore) to help leadership make data-driven decisions.  
The dashboard was created in **Power BI** and explores customer, product, regional, and discount performance.

---

## 🎯 Business Questions
1. How have sales evolved over time (2014–2017)?
2. Which product categories drive the most sales and profit?
3. Which regions are most/least profitable?
4. How do discounts affect profitability?

---

## 🔑 Key Insights
- 📈 **Sales Growth**: After a slight dip in 2015, sales grew strongly in 2016–2017, reaching ~$0.72M.  
- 🛋️ **Furniture Weakness**: Furniture generates significant revenue but struggles with profitability.  
- 🌍 **Regional Differences**: The **West region** is most profitable, while **Central and South** lag behind.  
- 💸 **Discount Trap**: High discounts (>40%) often lead to negative profit margins — large orders with deep discounts are especially unprofitable.

---

## 💡 Recommendations
- **Optimize Discounts**: Reduce or cap discounts, especially on low-margin products like Furniture.  
- **Regional Strategy**: Strengthen focus on the West (highest returns) and investigate strategies to improve performance in South and Central regions.  
- **Category Focus**: Continue investing in Technology (highest sales + profit) while reviewing cost structure for Furniture.  
- **Seasonality**: Capitalize on holiday sales peaks by aligning promotions with profitable products rather than deep discounts.
